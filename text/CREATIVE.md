IDEAS TO POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENT:

OVERVIEW: Hollowknight x Gris x Warbreaker x LOTR
	Stage 1 -- Beginnings:
	- start with no color (except red eyes) in a barren world deprived of color
	- find red sword in front of broken empty black vault and are asked if you want to try again
	
	Stage 2 -- Exploration:
	- are brought to a world full of color and under an invasion from a colonizing force
	- get asked how you came to wield that red sword, you are not permitted as a __ citizen to weild color
	- discover that color is magic and they're draining the world of color for ___ purpose
	
	Stage 3 -- Resistence: 
	- learn to wield color to fight off the invaders
	- in order to not damage the world through depleting the color, like the invaders, you need to first gain consent from
	from the nymphs/dryads/kami of the world to channel their colors
	- each color corresponds with an ability
	- your goal is to lock away each color in a vault to prevent the invaderers from stealing it from the land
	- locking the color away in the vault saves it from being drained but it locks the color away from the land
	- the only remanents of the color remain in your abilities and in the eyes of the people (and their muted clothes)
	
	Stage 4 -- Finality:
	- defending the vault which at the moment bleeds color into the pocket of the world around it
	- invading army catches on and tries to fight you with their stolen power to get to the vault
	- when you defeat an enemy, the stolen power runs along the ground in colorful rivulets back into the vault
	- after defeating the final big boss ___ you use all your color power and abilities to seal the vault
	- all color drains from the world and the vault fades into the scenery until there comes a time in the future
	when the world deems it safe to send out another hero to free its color and magic and let it roam freely once more
	
	Stage 5 -- Epilogue:
	- a young child (with colorful eyes?) comes to the vault overgrown with grey foliage many years down the line, 
	unlocking the vault and releasing the color within


LEVELS:
	i) Black
	ii) Red
	- red = sword
	iii) Blue
	iv) Green
	v) Orange
	vi) Purple
	
	Evolution of Color Saturation:
		1) Under occupation: land and people are full of color (maybe have desaturating around capture zones);
		   Color locked away: land is bleached, people have muted color and bright eyes;
		   Vault unlocked: land and people are full of color
	
	Before & After:
		- Each level has a before and after, which for most is color --> no/muted color
			- Black is the only one to go to no/muted color --> color
		- Each level has a with color - cheery musical score and a without color


ENTITIES:


VIBES:
	- idea is centered around that lotr feeling of the endless march of time, and even when you win,
	something essential to the uniqueness of the world is lost
